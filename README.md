# News - App
Overview
For this assignment, I developed a responsive React application that serves as a news portal, fetching articles from a public API. The application allows users to browse news articles, filter them by categories, implement pagination for easier navigation, and view detailed articles.

Features Implemented
Homepage Layout
The homepage displays a list of news articles with titles, images, and summaries. The design is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.

Category Filtering
Users can filter articles by categories such as Business, Technology, and Entertainment. This feature enhances user experience by presenting relevant content based on their interests.

Pagination
Pagination functionality enables users to navigate through multiple pages of articles efficiently. This ensures that the interface remains clean and manageable while accommodating a large number of articles.

Detailed Article View Page
Clicking on an article summary navigates users to a detailed view where they can read the full content. This view includes media elements like images or videos embedded within the article.

API Integration
I integrated a public news API (e.g., NewsAPI) to fetch real-time news articles. The application handles loading states and error handling gracefully to ensure smooth user interaction.

State Management
React hooks were utilized for managing state, handling user inputs, API responses, and application state effectively. Redux toolkit was employed for centralized state management, facilitating seamless data flow throughout the application.

Advanced Task (Optional)
As an advanced feature, I implemented a search functionality enabling users to search for articles by keywords. Additionally, a "favorites" feature was added where users can save articles, utilizing local storage to persist favorites between sessions.

Technical Implementation
Technologies: React, Redux Toolkit, Axios for API calls, CSS Grid for responsive design.
Development: Functional components and hooks were extensively used for building components and managing state. CSS was employed for styling, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
Deployment: The application was hosted using a free hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel), and the source code was version-controlled on GitHub for easy access and collaboration.
